PyMuPDF (often imported as fitz) is a library for working with PDFs, and it also supports rendering PDF pages as images.

Pillow is a Python Imaging Library (PIL) fork that is used for working with images

BytesIO is used to handle in-memory binary streams. It serves to store and manipulate the PDF image output before it is written to the final PDF file. It allows the images to be processed as PDF files in memory before being added to the output PDF.
